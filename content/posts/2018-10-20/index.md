What is IoT?
The Internet of Things (IoT) is the network of physical objects that contain embedded technology to communicate and sense or interact with their internal states or external environment. With this
unification of technology such as low-power embedded systems, cloud computing, big-data, machine learning and networking can be done.

Why IoT?
IoT or Internet of Things is network where each and every thing around you is going to be linked with internet, such as tables, fans, lights, watches etc these all will be fitted with embedded
systems, embedded electronics, information technology which different nodes of IoT, where basic computing platform is set to access advanced level of service. When these are set up in a system
they are going to help in connecting different other things that are around them and also help in transferring data. It gives efficient, scalable and efficient architecture. Unambiguous naming
and addressing, abundance of sleeping nodes, mobiles and non-IP devices

Now IoT is one of the main component required for building smart cities and smart homes and there has also been lot of interest in developing IoTs. In these smart cities different types of IoT
based applications are used ,such as smart parking, traffic controlling etc. In IoT the communication takes places between two different objects(such as sensors etc.) without human
intervention i.e it is machine-to-machine communication rather than a human-machine communication. Some of the areas where IoT can be enabled are RFID, Nanotechnology, sensors, smart networks etc.

In IoT we can link many sensors , objects etc. These are linked through POINT-TO-POINT ,STAR and MESH connection which is given below. In these three types of communication mesh has an
advantage over star and point-to-point network as you can see in star many sensors or objects are connected to gateway, if one of the object or sensor is not working it cannot transfer the
data to other objects or sensors as these are directly connected to the gateway and hence it causes a disruption in the data transfer, in point-to-point only one sensor or one object can be
connected to the gateway which is least efficient than star connection, whereas in mesh if any one of the object or sensor is not working it transfers data via other route rather than a
straight one as the sensors or objects are connected to gateway and also they are interconnected. Mesh connection increases the data transfer efficiency in a network.

Morden day applications of IoT include:
1)Smart parking 11)Forest fire detection
2)Smart healthcare 12)Air pollution
3)Traffic congestion 13)Snow level monitoring
4)Smart lighting 14)Water leakages
5)Waste management 15)Radiation levels
6)Smart roads 16)NFC payment
7)River floods 17)Intelligent shopping applications
8)Tank level 18)Landslide and Avalanche prevention
9)Water flow 19)Smart grids
10)Liquid presence 20)Smart product management
